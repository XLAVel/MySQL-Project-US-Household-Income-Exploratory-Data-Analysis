This project delves into the utilization of MySQL in the context of data transformation, exploratory analysis, and automation, focusing on its application in handling the US Household Income dataset to derive meaningful insights and identify general patterns in the data. These patterns include outliers and features of the data that might be unexpected. 

My professional engagement within this project entails the utilization of MySQL as a pivotal tool for facilitating enhanced comprehension of the dataset among stakeholders. These stakeholders represent a broad audience, primarily individuals keen on understanding various facets of salary distributions, geographic trends across states and cities, and other pertinent insights.

With a keen awareness of stakeholder interests, my approach involves presenting an updated exploratory analysis of the dataset, highlighting states and cities characterized by the highest average incomes alongside other salient categories that offer valuable insights.
